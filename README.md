This is my first completed game that was created for a project in my school, the class had no affiliation with game design, it was just what i chose to do. 
The game is about the mountain that is Gaming addiction (Ironic, right?) and some ways you can climb that mountain and overcome it.
Even though it was for school, it was mainly to create a goal and stick to it.
